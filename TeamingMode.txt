The -TeamingMode parameter in NIC Teaming specifies how the physical network adapters in the team operate together.
Here are the available options for the TeamingMode parameter:

SwitchIndependent:

The NIC team functions independently of the network switch.
The switch is unaware of the NIC team, and no special configuration is required on the switch.
Suitable for most scenarios, especially when connecting to different switches or when using Hyper-V.

Static:

The NIC team operates in a static link aggregation mode.
Requires manual configuration on the network switch to create a matching static team.
Adheres to the IEEE 802.3ad standard. Suitable for environments with switches that support static teaming.

LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol):

Uses the IEEE 802.1ax standard (formerly 802.3ad) to dynamically negotiate and manage link aggregation with the switch.
Requires switch support and configuration for LACP.
Offers better failover and load-balancing capabilities compared to static mode.
Ideal for environments where dynamic teaming is needed.
